<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://cse.seu.edu.cn/">School of Computer Science and Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.seu.edu.cn/">Southeast University</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://cs.seu.edu.cn/haochen303/main.htm">Prof. Hao Chen</a>. 
Previously, I received my bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from Southeast University in 2025. 

My research interests include multimodal learning and explainable AI (xAI).
I have published several papers at the top international AI conferences.
I will continue striving for academic excellence and impactful research.
